## Introduction
For the *Computer Graphics* course in the *Digital Media* bachelor study program at the [Fulda University of Applied Science](https://www.hs-fulda.de/en/home), we, @RamoramaInteractive, @Kathilein and @Mel-tem, developed a Snake3D game using the WebGL framework Three.js. It is a Snake3D clone that has been extended with new features. In addition to food, a diet pill also appears, which allows the snake to shrink again. Spears can sprout out of the ground and rocks can fall from the sky. With the Orbit Control it is possible to change the perspective of the game board.

## Future
The project is considered complete and will not be renewed. It no longer works in newer browsers and the code must be rewritten. Should there still be a remake of the game, then the repository will be replaced. 

If you are interested in renewing the game, you have the free choice to renew the game.

## Notes
The source code contains teething problems and needs renewal and better structuring. The game itself is in German.
